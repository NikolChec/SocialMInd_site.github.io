            <h2>About SocialMind</h2>
            <p>
                SocialMind is a youth-led educational initiative designed to help teens overcome social anxiety
                and develop real-world social confidence through immersive VR practice and AI-driven interactions.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- ========== THE PROBLEM ========== -->
        <section id="problem">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Many teens experience social anxiety. They fear speaking in class, joining conversations,
                or being judged by peers. Over time, avoidance becomes a habit — and students who look “fine”
                from the outside often struggle silently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Schools want to help, but support systems are overloaded.
                Counselors and psychologists must prioritize urgent cases,
                leaving many students without consistent guidance or safe practice opportunities.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- ========== OUR SOLUTION (HIGH LEVEL) ========== -->
        <section id="solution">
            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            <p>
                SocialMind transforms avoided social moments into safe, repeatable practice.
                Students enter realistic school-based scenarios in VR and interact with AI characters
                that respond in real time. They can rehearse challenging situations at their own pace,
                without fear of judgment.
            </p>

        <!-- ========== WHY VR + AI ========== -->
        <section id="why-vr-ai">
            <h3>Why VR and AI?</h3>
            <div class="card">
                <h4>VR Creates Real Feeling — Without Real Risk</h4>
                <p>
                    Virtual reality makes practice feel real enough to build skills,
                    while staying emotionally safe and controlled.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>AI Characters Make Practice Human</h4>
                <p>
                    Instead of scripted dialogues, AI characters react naturally,
                    allowing students to experience true conversation flow.
                </p>

        <!-- ========== VISION ========== -->
        <section id="vision">
            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>
                We believe quality education must include emotional and social growth, not only academic success.
                Our vision is a school environment where every student feels safe to participate, connect,
                and grow socially, emotionally, and academically.
            </p>
            <p>
                SocialMind aims to become a practical, modern tool that schools can use to support teens,
                reduce silent suffering, and strengthen belonging.
