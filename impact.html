                tested through real challenges, and guided by a mission to change how schools
                support teens with social anxiety.

            <h3>Raising Awareness in Schools</h3>
            <p>
                During development, we also led talks in our school about social anxiety and teen mental health.
                These sessions helped students and educators understand silent struggles,
                reduce stigma, and build a more supportive environment.
