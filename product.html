            <h2>How SocialMind Works</h2>
            <p>
                SocialMind turns avoided social moments into guided, repeatable VR practice.
                Each session blends immersive scenes with real-time AI interactions designed
                to help teens build confidence safely and gradually.

        <!-- ========== STEP 1 ========== -->
        <section id="step-1">
            <h3>Step 1 — Choose a Social Scenario</h3>
            <p>
                Students start by selecting a real-life school situation that usually feels stressful.
                Examples include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Introducing themselves to a group</li>
                <li>Joining a conversation at lunch</li>
                <li>Asking a question in class</li>
                <li>Talking to a supportive adult figure (like our virtual counselor “Alon”)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- ========== STEP 2 ========== -->
        <section id="step-2">
            <h3>Step 2 — Enter a VR Scene</h3>
            <p>
                With a VR headset, students step into a realistic school-based environment:
                a classroom, hallway, counselor’s office, or group of peers. The visuals,
                distance, eye contact, and tone create an immersive, emotionally engaging experience.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- ========== STEP 3 ========== -->
        <section id="step-3">
            <h3>Step 3 — Interact with AI Characters</h3>
            <p>
                Students talk naturally while AI-powered characters respond in real time.
                No scripts. No memorizing lines. Characters adjust their tone, pace, and reactions
                based on the student’s responses.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>Real Conversation Flow</h4>
                <p>
                    Instead of pre-recorded options, each interaction feels unique,
                    making practice feel authentic and relevant.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>Emotionally Safe Practice</h4>
                <p>
                    Students can retry as many times as they need — without fear of judgment.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- ========== STEP 4 ========== -->
        <section id="step-4">
            <h3>Step 4 — Reflection & Micro-Goals</h3>
            <p>
                After each session, a short reflection helps students recognize progress.
                They receive a small, achievable “micro-goal” for next time — such as:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>“Hold eye contact for one extra second.”</li>
                <li>“Say your name with a clear voice.”</li>
                <li>“Ask one simple question.”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These tiny steps reduce fear and gently build real-world courage.
            </p>
